=== Granite Rapids-SP ===
Granite Rapids-SP (Scalable Performance) uses the Beechnut City platform with the smaller [[LGA 4710]] socket, targeted towards mainstream server. It is a direct successor to Sapphire Rapids-SP and Emerald Rapids-SP that used the similarly sized [[LGA 4677]] socket. Granite Rapids-SP features up to 86 cores and 8-channel [[DDR5 SDRAM|DDR5]] memory support. [[Thermal design power|TDP]]s up to 350W are supported on Beechnut City platform.

=== Granite Rapids-AP ===
Granite Rapids-AP (Advanced Performance) uses the Avenue City platform with the larger [[LGA 7529]] socket. With the larger socket, Granite Rapids-AP SKUs reach higher core counts up to 128 and support 96 PCIe 5.0 lanes and 12-channel [[DDR5 SDRAM|DDR5]] memory (Up to 3 TB (1 [[DIMM]] per channel) or up to 6 TB (2 DIMM per channel) while using 256GB memory modules in both variants). Increased [[Thermal design power|TDP]]s up to 500W are supported on Avenue City platform.<ref>{{cite web |last=Alcorn |first=Paul |date=September 24, 2024 |title=Intel Launches Granite Rapids Xeon 6900P series with 128 cores — matches AMD EPYC's core counts for the first time since 2017 |url=https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-launches-granite-rapids-xeon-6900p-series-with-120-cores-matches-amd-epycs-core-counts-for-the-first-time-since-2017 |website=Tom's Hardware |language=en-US |access-date=September 24, 2024}}</ref> Granite Rapids is the first time that Intel has used the Advanced Performance moniker since the release of [[Cascade Lake]] in April 2019.<ref name="Morgan 2023-09-22"/>
